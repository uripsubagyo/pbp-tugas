            "review": "This adaptation of Jadi Pocong series in early 2000s brought back so many nostalgias and memories. I remember watching the series back in the days. To see the iconic character of Mumun in the modern era is quite refreshing. This movie was more of a horror comedy, just like the original series. The storyline was light, there were many funny scenes, the drama parts were heart touching, but the horror aspects were not that scary. The characters of Mimin and Juned were definitely the standouts in this movie. This movie was a nice treat to the original fans of the series, including myself. But overall, it could've been a lot better, imo."

            "review": "Mendarat Darurat has the right formula as a romantic comedy. The comedy side and the romantic side complement each other making this film fun to watch. The audience's initial introduction to the characters in the film's storyline and the introduction of the series of conflicts that later colored their lives were successfully delivered with a fairly thick comical energy. Reza Rahadian, Luna Maya and Marissa Anita wer able to provide quite satisfactory acting. Congrats to Pandji to be able to move on and grow up from the failure of Partikelir. This movie is better than expected and will suprise you in a good way."

            "review": "I was bored for most of this. I didn't care. The presence of Hanks normally ensures a certain quality - not this time. The FX are ropey. The cat and pinocchio are not well done. Its being described as a live action remake, but most of the characters are CGI.Parts of it move along at a speed and others seem to drag. Tom Hanks cannot save this. Its an overblown, empty experience. Its saving grace is that we didn't have to sit through too much singing. Though some of the songs from the Disney cartoon are there in part. I'm guessing this went straight to Disney+ as it would have been a massive flop if it went to cinemas."

Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team. Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait."

The cinematography is beautiful. Miller who shows his versatility in a break from his typical movies. That being said it is noticeably a George Miller movie in style. Recommend this one very much, it does not feel too artsy but at the same time is not your typical fantasy movie. This movie is a marvelous artistic depiction of fundamental spiritual concepts that will leave some cold and indifferent while enchanting the initiated in the spiritual paths of the primordial tradition."

This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!"
